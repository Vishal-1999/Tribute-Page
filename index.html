        <h2 class="text-center text-justify">Short Biography</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>On May 14th, 1984, Mark Zuckerberg was born. Currently he is only 31 and he is one of the 5 founders of the biggest
          social networking site – Facebook. In 2015, his net worth was estimated at $35.7 billion. But the fact that he is one of
          the youngest billionaires is the less interesting one. The cool stuff here is actually his start up story, describing
          how a kid became the founder and later the manager of one of the most influential websites on Earth. Below is the
          amazing story of this young entrepreneur and his creation – Facebook.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-center text-justify">Early Life</h2>
        <ul><li>Mark began writing software and using computers when he was in middle school. His coding experience began with learning
        Atari basic programming, with the help of his father. But he was learning so fast, that daddy needed to hire a
        professional developer to tutor him. David Newman was the man, who was given the task to mentor the young Mark. It was a
        tough task for the teacher, because the student was developing his skills so quickly, that Newman experienced serious
        difficulties to stay ahead of him. At high school Mark excelled in his classes he won prizes in astronomy, physics, and
        mathematics. While he was still in high school, he took a college graduate program in computer programming. He built a
        program called Zucknet where the computer at home could communicate with his father’s computer at his dental practice.
        He also used his creativity to build computer games often out of ideas his friends would draw for him. When he
        eventually went to go to college, he claimed to be able to read and write in Latin, French, Hebrew, English and Greek.
        His overall knowledge and intelligence helped him excel at college, where he would often recite poems such as the epic
        ‘The Iliad’.</li></ul>

        <h2 class="text-center text-justify">In College</h2>
        <ul><li>In college, the students have books called “Facebooks.” They have the pictures and names of people that lived in the
        student dorms. Mark build a website that randomly showed two pictures of males and two of females on it. People that
        visited the site had to choose which person was hotter. This site went up over one weekend and it was called Facemash
        (actually this was the first name of Facebook). It was built ‘just for fun’ but it became so popular, that the college
        shut it down because of its popularity. First it caused the Harvard’s servers to crash (because of the heavy load it
        caused) and this caused problems for the student, who wanted to use the Internet. Also, some students didn’t like the
        idea of their pictures being used without permission and Zuckerberg was forced to apologize for his actions.</li></ul>
